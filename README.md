## Flight Search: Assignment Description

Develop an Android app in order to be able to find out, to a given destination airport, whether and if so, which airlines fly there directly, from which departure airport, from a certain country. If there is no direct flight option, a list of countries and airports should alternatively be displayed to which the search can be continued recursively.
For instance your flight destination would be South Africa, may be the airport of Johannesburg. Is it possible to fly there directly from your home country? Which airports in your near provide a direct flight connection and may be which airline serves it?
